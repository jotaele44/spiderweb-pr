"""
Tests for the RLSM extraction-first pipeline.

Verifies the structural invariants required by the spec:
  1. every image has exactly one screenshots row
  2. every processed screenshot has an OCR attempt record
  3. raw OCR is never overwritten
  4. labeled POIs and unlabeled candidates are stored in SEPARATE tables
  5. failed files are recorded in the screenshots table (never silently skipped)
  6. duplicate groups are recorded
  7. exports are reproducible (running the exporter twice produces identical bytes)
